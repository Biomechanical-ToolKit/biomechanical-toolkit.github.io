          <p>Mokka is now able to plot acquisition's data in 2D Charts!</p>
          <p>
            <b>New Features</b>
            <ol>
              <li>Chart viewer to display analog signals and components of points (markers, angles, forces, etc.) into 2D plots.</li>
              <li>Export plot to bitmap images.</li>
              <li>Console logger to display all the messages coming from Mokka or its dependencies.</li>
              <li>New Layout Manager to save and load the layout of the views and their properties.</li>
              <li>New items in the model pane to represent force platform reactions (force, moment, position).</li>
              <li>Acquisition can now be reframed from the index 1. The events are adapted in consequence.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Usability Improvements</b>
            <ol>
              <li>Sticks used to display segments are now wider (line width set to 2).</li>
              <li>Improvement in the memory management of the views.</li>
              <li>UI modified for the checker of update when there is no update or when an error occurred.</li>
              <li>The axes used to show the orientation of the 3D view are scaled to have a fixed and squared size.</li>
              <li>Actions in the model configuration menu (gear button) were splitted. All the actions related to the model tree are in a contextual menu.</li>
              <li>The model panel is no more hidden and then shown when an acquisition is loaded (and the model panel is already visible).</li>
              <li>Acquisition file formats containing only analog data can be opened directly.</li>
              <li>Menu actions updated to be able to import RIF file and export force platform CAL file.</li>
              <li>(MacOS X only) The preferences window under MacOS X seems native (animation for height, zoom button disabled, no toolbar button, no resize indicator).</li>
              <li>(Windows only): Windows VersionInfo are now set for Mokka.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Issues resolved</b>
            <ul>
              <li>List of markers stated as visible into the model pane is wrong under Windows 7 64-bit (issue 14)</li>
              <li>If the unit for the markers is set to meter in the first loaded acquisition, then the coordinates are not correctly scaled.</li>
              <li>In some case in the 3D perspective view, the camera is translated instead of rotated when switching from another application (using the key sequence Alt + Tab).</li>
              <li>Checker of update can be wrongly triggered with alpha release number.</li>
              <li>(MacOS X only) Under MacOS X, the shortcut Command + M is used to minimize the application. The shortcut used to view the model panel is now set to Command + Shift + M (only under MacOS X).</li>
              <li>Minor UI fixes</li>

          <p>A new project based on the code of <a href="http://b-tk.googlecode.com">BTK</a> is born. Its goal is to use widely the modules of BTK and especially the <a href="http://b-tk.googlecode.com/svn/doc/API/0.1/group___b_t_k_v_t_k.html">BTKVTK</a> module.</p>
          <p>Its source code will be integrated directly into BTK. This is a cross-platform GUI application and it uses the great of <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/">Qt</a> library to do it.</p>
          <p>This first initial alpha release (0.1a1) is able to visualize the markers in a 3D view and are listed in a panel on the side. You can select the visualized frame with the slider on the bottom of the window. The playback button starts and stops the acquisition.</p>
