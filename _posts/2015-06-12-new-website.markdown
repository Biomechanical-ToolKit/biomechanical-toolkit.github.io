Because Google Code will [close] soon, the project is moving to its GitHub mirror. With this moving, we profit of the tools proposed by GitHub to re-structure the project. This gives us also the possibility to create a _true_ website and not a wiki only. This new website will be improved during the next months to centralize all the information related to the project (user guide, developer guide, media, etc.)
