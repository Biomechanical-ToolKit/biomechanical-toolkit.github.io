It is a pleasure to announce the revamping of the Biomechanical ToolKit project by the [Moveck] company.<!--more-->

The Matlab and Python bindings of BTK will be available freely as [Bridge]. To simplify the usage of the bindings, the proposed API will correspond to the same as the Matlab one. 

The Python API will be a mirror of the Matlab API but for Python 3.x! This will be way simpler than the usage of the C++ API into Python.

 - The new documentation will be hosted on the website of Moveck.
 - Apple Silicon processors will be supported.
 - Some known fixes will be corrected (e.g., non-ASCII characters in filenames).
 - New functions will be available (e.g., btkGetRotations to get access to rotation matrices stored in some C3D files).

[Bridge] and [Explore] are designed for effortless handling of massive data processing. It complements applications like [Pipe] and [Cleanse], all created to meet the demand for quick and efficient data management.
